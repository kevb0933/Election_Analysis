# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

A Board of Election commission members requested my help in retrieving more data to complete an election audit of a recent local election. The following are the tasks completed for the election audit.

	1. The voter turnout for each county.
	2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
	3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
	4. Retrieve the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
	6. Determine the county with the highest turnout.
	5. Determine the winner of the election.
